  "summary": "The diff implements several requirements but has notable gaps. REQ-22 (title fix), REQ-23 (FarmingChatbot removal), REQ-24 (stub page redirects), REQ-25 (stub components), REQ-26 (stub hooks), REQ-27 (Home page improvements), REQ-30 (Admin Panel system reports), and partial REQ-31 (dark mode classes on some pages) appear addressed. However, REQ-28 (Applied Jobs count badge on Job Seeker Dashboard) and REQ-29 (bulk status update in Employer Dashboard) show no evidence of implementation in the diff.",
